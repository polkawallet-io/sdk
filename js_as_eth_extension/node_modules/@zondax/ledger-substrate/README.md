This package provides a basic client library to communicate with Substrate Apps running in a Ledger Nano S/X devices

Additionally, it provides a hd_key_derivation function to retrieve the keys that Ledger apps generate with
BIP32-ED25519. Warning: the hd_key_derivation function is not audited and depends on external pacakges. We recommend
using the official Substrate Ledger apps in recovery mode.
